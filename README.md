USAGE

Open your shell, go the same directory of this file and type:

python pythonbird.py

Follow the instrucrtions. Actually you can unfollow people who don't follow you or send mass-DM to all your followers.
The code is not optimized and is a little bit slow. There are many things to do to make it better. 

=============
AUTHORIZATIONS

The Auth system requires that you register this app at http://dev.twitter.com and paste the consumer key and consumer secret in consumer.py file before starting the app (only the first time it starts).
I am thinking about a better auth system in the future.
