EXTERNAL DEPENDANCIES

This code requires Tweepy package available at https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy
Simply get it and paste it in the same directory of this README.md file.

=============
USAGE

Open your shell, go the same directory of this file and type:

python pythonbird.py

Follow the instructions. Actually you can unfollow people who don't follow you or send mass-DM to your followers.
The code is not optimized and is a little bit slow. There are many things to do in the future to make it better. 

=============
AUTHORIZATIONS

The Auth system requires that you register this app at http://dev.twitter.com (Twitter Developers).
After registration, paste "consumer key" and "consumer secret" in consumer.py file.
For now, this procedure is required before the first time you launch this app.
I am thinking about a better auth system in the future.
